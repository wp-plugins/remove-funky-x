Remove Funky X - 2.0.0 (05.01.2010)

Don't you hate it when your posts get things like 1Ã—01 and wish it was easy to make it do 1x01 without editing the wordpress code?
This plugin does just that. This plugin removes the funky X's that wordpress adds on #x# patterns in titles and posts. (# is any digit).

Installation:
   Just copy to regular plugins or install via plugin manager and activate.
   That is all.

Revision History:
   2.0.0 Jan 5, 2010
    Provided Update to make compatible with WP Upgrade 2.9.1
    This was a rewrite to detour function, call function, and then replace value.
    The old method of just detouring the function needed the script updated every-time 
    wordpress made any significant changes to its functions, more specifically wp_texturize.
    This should make it more resilient to wordpress upgrades.
